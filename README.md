## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/BFlameSwift/BFlameSwift.github.io/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/BFlameSwift/BFlameSwift.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

[User Manual 👉](_doc/Manual.md)
--------------------------------------------------

### Getting Started

1. You will need [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) to use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Following [Using Jekyll with Bundler](https://jekyllrb.com/tutorials/using-jekyll-with-bundler/) to fullfill the enviromental requirement.

2. Installed dependencies in the `Gemfile`:

```sh
$ bundle install 
```

3. Serve the website (`localhost:4000` by default):

```sh
$ bundle exec jekyll serve  # alternatively, npm start
```

### Development (Build From Source)

To modify the theme, you will need [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/). There are numbers of tasks you can find in the `Gruntfile.js`, includes minifing JavaScript, compiling `.less` to `.css`, adding banners to keep the Apache 2.0 license intact, watching for changes, etc. 

Yes, they were inherited and are extremely old-fashioned. There is no modularization and transpilation, etc.

Critical Jekyll-related code are located in `_include/` and `_layouts/`. Most of them are [Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki) templates.

This theme uses the default code syntax highlighter of jekyll, [Rouge](http://rouge.jneen.net/), which is compatible with Pygments theme so just pick any pygments theme css (e.g. from [here](http://jwarby.github.io/jekyll-pygments-themes/languages/javascript.html) and replace the content of `highlight.less`.
